# Terraform AWS Backup

Terraform module to provision [AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/) resources.

## Terraform versions

Terraform 0.13. Pin module version to `~> v1.0`. Submit pull-requests to `master` branch.

## Usage

```hcl
module "backup" {
  source = "umotif-public/backup/aws"
  version = "~> 1.0"

  vault_name        = "test-rds-aurora"
  vault_kms_key_arn = "arn:aws:kms:eu-west-1:1111111111:key/07a8a813-fcc9-4d7f-a982648d9c25"

  tags = {
    Environment = "test"
  }

  plan_name = "test-backup-plan"

  rules = [
    {
      name              = "test-backup-rule"
      schedule          = "cron(0 12 * * ? *)"
      start_window      = "65"
      completion_window = "180"
      recovery_point_tags = {
        Project = "test"
        Region  = "eu-west-1"
      }

      lifecycle = {
        cold_storage_after = 0
        delete_after       = 90
      }
    }
  ]

  selection_name = "test-backup-selection"
  selection_resources = ["arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:1111111111:cluster:example-database-1"]

  selection_tags = [
    {
      type  = "STRINGEQUALS"
      key   = "Project"
      value = "Test"
    },
    {
      type  = "STRINGEQUALS"
      key   = "Environment"
      value = "test"
    }
  ]
}
```
